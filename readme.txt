By the time this repository is being viewed it should contain at the very least several files. 

The first file that should jump at you is the content of my "primer" intro which is in git-primer.txt. This probably isn't too useful to you guys, but it let me refresh myself while organizing my thoughts.

The other files include some graphics, a powerpoint and most importantly, the git.anki file which has in it the anki flash cards I created to help me remember the most common uses for git. Many of the flash cards I created were more or less taken from gitref.org, but reformatted into a quiz-like format. I have found these very helpful when I've been diligent enough to use them. Spaced repetition studying rocks, and the Anki iPhone app comes highly recommended.
