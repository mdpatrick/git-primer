By the time this repository is being viewed it should contain at the very least three or four files. 

The first file that should jump at you is the content of my "primer" intro which is in git-primer.txt. This probably isn't too useful to you guys, but it let me refresh myself while sorting out my thoughts about what I was going to say. It will be interesting to see how literally I follow this script.

The other files include some graphics, a powerpoint and most importantly, the git.anki file.

## Anki ##
Contained within git.anki are the anki flash cards I created to help me remember the most common use commands for git. Many of the flash cards I created were more or less taken from gitref.org, but reformatted into a quiz-like format. I have found these very helpful when I've been diligent enough to use them. Spaced repetition studying rocks, and the Anki iPhone app comes highly recommended.
