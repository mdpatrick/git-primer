By the time this repository is being viewed it should contain at the very least several files. One, being the content of my "primer" intro which is in git-primer.txt.

The other files include some graphics, and most importantly, the git.anki file which has in it the anki flash cards I created to help me remember the most common uses for git. Many of the flash cards I created were more or less taken from gitref.org, but reformatted into a quiz-like format. I have found these very helpful when I've been diligent enough to use them. Spaced repetition studying rocks, and the Anki iPhone app comes highly recommended.
